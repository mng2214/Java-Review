map() takes Stream<T> and returns Stream<T>
It is mapper function produces single value for each input value
It is called : One-To-One mapping

flatMap() takes Steam<Stream<T>> as input and returns Stream<T>
It is mapper function produces multiple value for each input value
It is called : One-To-Many mapping

Stream.of(1,2,3,4); -> [1,2,3,4]
[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]] -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]  Flatting / flatMap()
